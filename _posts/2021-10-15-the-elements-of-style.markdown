## Lesson 1: Elementary Rules of Usage
  1. Form the possessive singular of noun by adding 's. Exceptions to this rule are nouns
  which end with s or es, for the ones with s just put ` at the end and reform the sentence
  for the ones with es.  
  a. This is Deepak's document.  
  b. I am not doing this for righteous' sake.  
  c. The terror of Isis.  

  2. In a series of three or more terms in conjugation, use comma after all the terms except
  the last one.
  a. Blue, Green, Black, and Green are colors.  

  3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
    a. The best way to see a country, unless you are low on time, is to travel by foot.
    instead of, the best way to see a country (unless you are low on time) is to travel by foot.
    b. If the parenthetical expression breaks the flow of the sentence only slightly, then
    omit comma. The sentences split by comma can often be written as two
    statements.  
      i. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  
      c. It's a standard practice to omit commas from a date.  
      d. The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more, interested.
      or
      The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more interested.  

  4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.  
  a. When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a
  comma is useful if the connective is but.  
  b. When the connective is and the comma should be omitted if the relation between
  the two statements is close or immediate.  

  5. Do not join independent clauses with the comma. If two or more clauses grammatically
  complete and not joined by a conjunction are to form a single compound sentence, the
  proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon.  
    a. It's nearly half past five; I should leave for home.  
    b. Ofcourse, it is okay to write these as two independent statements separated by
    period.  
    c. If they are joined by conjugation then we need to put comma as suggested in the
    previous lesson.  
    d. Comma is preferable when the clauses are very short, alike in form, or when the
    told of the sentence is easy and conversational.  

  6. Do not use periods for commas. In other words, do not break the sentence into two.  

  7. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list of particulars, an appositive
  (is a noun or noun phrase that renames another noun right beside it), an amplification 
  (the action of enlarging upon or adding detail to a story or statement.), or an illustrative
  quotation.  
    a. Understanding is that penetrating quality of knowledge that grows from: theory,
    practice, conviction, assertion, error, and humiliation.  
    b. Join two independent clauses with a colon if the second interprets or amplifies
    the first.  
    c. A colon may introduce a quote that supports or contributes to the preceding
    clause.  

  8. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or introduction or to announce a long appositive or
  summary.  
    a. Dash separation is stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon and more
    relaxed than parentheses.  
    b. It should be used only when other form of separations seem inadequate.  
    c. The first thought on getting out of bed - if he had any thought at all - was to get back
    in again.  

  9. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb.  
    a. Use a singular verb form after each, either, everyone, everybody, nobody, neither
    and someone.  
    b. Although both clocks strike cheerfully, neither keeps good time.  
    c. With none, use singular verb only when none refers to no one or not one.  
    d. A plural verb is commonly used when none suggests more than one person or
    thing. Example: None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right.  

  10. A participial (verb used as noun or adjective) phrase at the beginning of a sentence must
  refer to the grammatical subject (not sentence subject).  

## Lesson 2: Elementary Principles of Composition  

  1. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic.  
    a. The beginning of each paragraph is a signal to him that a new step in the
    development of the subject has been reached.  
    b. The extent of subdivision will vary with the length of the composition.  
    c. Single sentences shouldn't be written or printed as paragraphs.  
    d. In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is a paragraph by itself; that
    is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker.  
    e. Examples of subjects of paragraphs:  
      * Writing the summary of a novel:
        - Setting.
        - Plot.
        - Characters.
        - Purpose.
      * Writing about an historical event:
        - What led up to the event.
        - Account of the event.
        - What the event led up to.  

  2. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in conformity with the
  beginning.  
    a. The topic sentence comes at or near at the beginning.  
    b. The succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in  
    the topic sentence; and  
    c. The final statement either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or  
    states some important consequence.  
    d. The meaning of the topic sentence is often made clearer by denial of the  
    contrary. 

  3. Use the active voice.  
    a. Active voices are more direct, concise and demonstrate ownership.  
    b. The need of making a particular word the subject of the sentence will often
    determine which voice is to be used.  
    c. Avoid making one passive depend directly upon another.  

  4. Put statements in positive form.  
    a. Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colourless, hesitating, and non-committal
    language.  
    b. The negative word other than not are usually strong.  

  5. Avoid a succession of loose sentences.  
    a. The bad paragraphs are often badly structured, have mechanical symmetry and
    sing-song.  
    b. Remove the monotony of sentences in a paragraph by replacing them with
    simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic
    sentences of two clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three clauses -
    whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.  

  6. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.  
    a. Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory
    method is employed.
    Should be replaced with,
    Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, now it is taught by the
    laboratory method.  
    b. The article or a preposition applying to all the members of a series much either
    be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.  
    c. Restructure the sentences to make sure that co-ordinate ideas are presented in
    the same form. Example,
    It was both a long ceremony and very tedious.
    Can be replaced by,
    The ceremony was both long and tedious.  
  
  7. Keep related words together.  
    a. The relative pronoun should come immediately after its antecedent.  
      i. There was a look in his eye that boded mischief.  
      In his eye was a look that boded mischief.  
  
  8. In summaries, keep to one tense.  
    a. In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the present
    tense.  
    b. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he should preferable use the present,
    though he may use the past if he prefers.  
    c. The summary should aim to write an orderly discussion supported by evidence,
    not a summary with occasional comment.  
  
  9. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.  
    a. The proper place for the word, or group of words, which the writer desires to
    make most prominent is usually the end of the sentence.
    The steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness.
    Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors.   
    b. The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most prominent in the
    end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the sentences of a paragraph,
    and to the paragraphs of a composition.
